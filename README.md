<h1>Holiday Helper by Wong Hong Hei</h1>

<p>A web-based system that allows users to find nearby hotels, food, or attractions together with the 7-day weather forecast and YouTube videos showcasing the places based on their searches. This system integrates several free external APIs such as Google Map API, YouTube API, WeatherBit API, and TimeZoneDB API.</p>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Throughout the years, most of the people were having some problems or
difficulties when coming to planning for a holiday trip.</p>
<p>A lot of people claim that they have a hard time finding a place to
stay near their travel location or having difficulties in finding attraction
spots and restaurants near their place of stay.</p>
<p>Besides, they also cannot view multiple hotels or Airbnb reviews in
one place and also do not have the ability to compare hotels and Airbnb
easily since hotels and Airbnb sometimes are not categorized in the same
category.</p>
<p>Here, we provide a RESTful web application that eases the users to plan
their holiday trips</p>
